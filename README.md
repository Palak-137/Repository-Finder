# RepoFinder 🔍
This is a single-page application that you can use to find the public repository available on Github. We used the GitHub API to get the data of the repository.
You can also visit the profile of the user owning the repo. Not only this, you can re-arrange the order of repo they appear by simply drag and drop.
